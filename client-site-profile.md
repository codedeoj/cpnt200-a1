## Adapt and Critique
**Is this site well structured?**

The site uses minimal design and shows good visual hierarchy. The products uses images and text to display useful information. The simple design allows user to easily navigate through the list and select their desired product.

**What could be improved?**

Provide more general information about the business to help customers understand more about the company such as a brand story or the people behind the business.

Another thing that could be improve is to add more product options and then group products into categories and subcategories. Also, allow shoppers to sort and filter results based on various options (lowest or highest price, best seller, newest, ratings, etc.)

**Why would someone choose this company over their competition?**

The price is right and they offer good quality.

**How will this website relate to your Strapi Project?**

This is a good example of website that I want to build as my Strapi project. A simple and clean ecommerce website but with a more modern look.
